// Approach 2: Graham's Scan // Playing with the big boys now
// Intuition: find the rightmost and leftmost elements, they both belong the CH
// the line between them separates the polygon into two parts, upper and lower. 
// maintain two stacks for each part.
// check every element P : if orientation (L,P,R) is clockwise then it belongs to the upper part ,
// if it's counterclockwise then it belongs to the lower part

// The idea is to create the top part clockwise, and the lower part counterclockwise
// You will do that with the upper and lower stacks

// the leftmost element belongs to both stack
// each consecutive element that belongs to the CH has to be:

// Both cases start with p1 and naively add more elements that are clockwise/ccw to the upper/lower stacks
// each time there's a problem with the last 2 elements, (different orientation), the element is popped as it cannot possible be on the convex hull and be counterclockwise on the upper /ccw on the lower
// runs in O(N logN)
